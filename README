Latent Struct is a software package, written in C++, that provides routines for
training classifiers on data that contain structured latent variables.
Currently, log-linear and max-margin (i.e., support vector machine) models can
be trained. A given model can then be employed to make predictions on unseen
data. In addition to choosing between log-linear and max-margin models, one may
also train either a binary or a multiclass variant of each. Training of fully
supervised models (i.e., no latent variables) is also supported.

Although the source code has been commented to some extent, it has not been
systematically documented. Additional documentation, including usage examples
involving publicly available datasets, will be added in the near future.
